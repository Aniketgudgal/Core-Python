'''Q 3. Write a java program to enter two numbers and perform all arithmetic operations. '''
a = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
c = a+b;
d = a - b;
e = a * b;
f = a / b;
g = a // b; # division without fraction
h = a % b;
# print("Addition of two number is: "(a+b))
print("Addition of two number is: ",c)

# print("Substration of two number is: "(a-b))
print("Substration of two number is: ",d)

# print("Multiplication of two number is: "(a*b))
print("Multiplication of two number is: ",e)

#print("Divison of two number is: "(a/b))
print("division of two number is: ",f)

# print("division without fraction is: "(a//b))
print("Divison without fraction is: ",g)

# print("Remander is: "(a%b))
print("Remander is: ",h)
