## 📝 Program Descriptions

### Special Number Concepts

**Neon Number**: A number whose sum of digits of its square equals the number itself.
- Example: 9 → 9² = 81 → 8 + 1 = 9 ✓

**Spy Number**: A number where the sum of all digits equals the product of all digits.
- Example: 1412 → Sum(1+4+1+2) = 8, Product(1×4×1×2) = 8 ✓

**Palindrome Number**: A number that reads the same forwards and backwards.
- Example: 121, 1331, 12321

### Decision Making Concepts

**Even or Odd**: Determines if a number is even (divisible by 2) or odd.
- Example: 4 is even, 7 is odd

**Leap Year**: A year is a leap year if divisible by 4, but not every year divisible by 100, except if also divisible by 400.
- Example: 2000 and 2020 are leap years, 1900 is not

**Positive, Negative, or Zero**: Classifies a number as positive (>0), negative (<0), or zero (=0).
- Example: -5 is negative, 3 is positive, 0 is neither

**Largest of Three**: Finds the largest number among three given numbers.
- Example: Among 3, 7, and 5, the largest is 7

**Grade Calculation**: Assigns a grade based on marks using if-elif-else conditions.
- Example: 85 marks → Grade A, 70 marks → Grade B

### Contribution Guidelines

- Follow Python naming conventions (PEP 8)
- Add comments explaining the logic
- Include example input/output in comments
- Test your code before submitting
- Update the README if adding new programs

## 📋 Code Style

All programs in this repository follow these conventions:

- **Naming**: Descriptive variable names (camelCase or snake_case)
- **Comments**: Triple-quoted docstrings for problem statements
- **Input**: Clear prompts for user input
- **Output**: Descriptive output messages
- **Structure**: Simple, readable code suitable for beginners

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Some programs reference "Java" in comments but are Python implementations
- The `Operators/README.md` file also references Java instead of Python

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Add more advanced programs (loops, functions, classes)
- Include unit tests for each program
- Add error handling and input validation
- Create separate directories for different topics
- Add more complex algorithms and data structures
